/**
 * Renders on-top chrome inside the activity window instead of a Dialog window.
 *
 * A `LayerBackdrop` only samples correctly inside the window that produced it — the offset between
 * consumer and producer is resolved through shared `LayoutCoordinates`, which two windows do not
 * have. That is why [os.kei.ui.page.main.widget.glass.LiquidBackdropWindowBoundary] blanks
 * `LocalSceneBackdrop` for Dialog and Popup content: a sheet hosted in its own window can only fake
 * glass with a flat translucent fill, because every `blur()` it asks for resolves against
 * `emptyBackdrop()` and draws nothing.
 *
 * So anything that wants real Liquid Glass has to stay in the activity window. Compose has no
 * in-window z-order escape — drawing order follows the tree, so a sheet declared inside a page draws
 * underneath the floating docks, toolbar and bottom bar that the host declares after it. This host
 * is the escape hatch: callers register content from wherever they sit in the tree and it is composed
 * at the top of the activity window, as a sibling of (and therefore above) the whole app.
 *
 * The host must sit *outside* the `Modifier.layerBackdrop` producer. Inside it, the overlay would be
 * captured into the very backdrop it samples, which the library documents as a draw loop and a
 * RenderThread SIGSEGV, not a soft failure.

     * dynamic background invalidates the draw tree at its 60fps cap, and *every* one of those
     * invalidations re-rasterizes each glass surface above it, because each `drawBackdrop` re-records
     * its own offscreen effect layer per draw. With a modal up, all of that lands underneath a
     * blurred, dimmed plate where none of it can be seen.
     *
     * Measured before this gate existed: a sheet open over Home, untouched, sat at 124-141ms per
     * frame against 16ms for the same page with no sheet — about 7fps for a static screen. See
     * `docs/planning/liquid-sheet-frame-cost.md`.

     * page, so freezing the background behind one would be a visible stall bought for nothing.
